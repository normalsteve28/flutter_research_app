  """\t\tA Myocardial Infarction, more commonly recognized as a Heart Attack, is a condition that disturbs your heart\’s rhythm and its ability to pump blood throughout the body. 

    Damages of higher severity may ensue from the irregularity of the heart\’s function caused by an attack. 

    Possible risks include kidney disorders, heart failure, peripheral arterial disease, and another heart attack.  

    This health issue occurs when a coronary artery is blocked, resulting in the loss of blood traveling to a cardiac muscle. 

    The heart becomes exceedingly deprived of oxygen and other nutrients necessary for it to function and remain healthy. 
    
    During cases of Heart attack, First Aid is essential in minimalizing injury and preventing impairment to the cardiovascular system. This can also be done while waiting for professional help. 
    
The procedures are as follows: 
1. Calm the person down to avoid further aggravation.
2. Let him or her sit down and relax.
3. If the person is wearing tight clothing, loosen it up. 
4. If he or she possesses medication for their diagnosed heart condition, assist them in taking it. 
5. Call for emergency help if pain persists after resting or 3 minutes after taking medication.
6. Begin CPR procedures or call a local emergency number if the person is unresponsive or is not breathing.

  '''   Certain conditions can lead to the events of a heart attack. One of which is a disease called hypertension.
    
    Hypertension, or High Blood Pressure, is when a person\’s blood pressure is higher than normal. 
The long-term force of blood on the artery walls creates damage on the surface and can cease the flow of blood to the cardiac muscle. 
This may result in future health issues concerning that of your heart. 

    This condition comes in stages, ranging in severity. These stages are as follows:

Normal: 
    This first stage is considered the "normal" stage. The systolic level of an individual with normal blood pressure is less than 120 mm Hg or a diastolic rate of less than 80 mm Hg. An individual would not need care at this stage due to its normality. It is still necessary to monitor your blood pressure for the preservation of your health. 

Elevated: 
    This stage is also known as prehypertension. Systolic mm Hg is between 120 or 129 mm Hg and diastolic mm Hg less than 80. Prevention can still be applied at this stage. However, they are at risk of hypertension which could lead to subsequent heart disease or stroke. 
At this point, medicine is often not prescribed. However, to prevent hypertension, a person must make changes to his or her lifestyle. This could mean quitting cigarettes or making dietary alterations. Exercise is another good step to reducing your blood pressure.

Hypertension Stage 1: 
    This is the stage in which a person is at risk of various health complications. Systolic is between 130 and 139 mm Hg, and diastolic between 80 and 89 mm Hg. At this point, lifestyle changes are prescribed and blood pressure medication may be considered to decrease their blood pressure and risk of heart attack and/or stroke. 

Hypertension Stage 2: 
    Systolic is at 140 mm Hg or higher and diastolic at 90 mm Hg or higher. At this stage, there is a higher risk of heart attack and stroke. Doctors are likely to prescribe a combination of lifestyle changes and blood pressure medications.

Hypertensive Crisis:
    This stage is marked by a blood pressure reading higher than 180/120 mm Hg (Systolic greater than 180, Diastolic greater than 120). This is the most severe stage of high blood pressure and requires immediate medical attention. Wait for 5 minutes and measure your blood pressure again. If your blood pressure is still high, contact your doctor immediately. If you're experiencing chest pain, breathing problems, vision problems, back pain, numbness/weakness, difficulty speaking, or any other signs of a stroke or a heart attack, call 911 or your local emergency number immediately.

  '''   For early detection of hypertension, it is important to know the symptoms and causes. 
This allows an individual to make the necessary changes in her life for better health. 

Symptoms of this ailment may vary depending on severity. These include:
  - Nosebleed
  - Pounding in the chest, neck, or ears
  - Fatigue 
  - Headaches
  - Visual Changes
  - Vision problems
  - Difficulty breathing
  - Irregular beating of the heart
  - Urination with blood
  - Pain in the chest
  - Confusion
  - Flushing

Causes include:
  - Sleep Apnea
  - Defects In The Blood Vessels
  - Thyroid problems
  - Intake Of Drugs Such As Cocaine and Amphetamines
  - Tumors In Adrenal Gland
  - Medications, such as birth control pills, cold remedies, decongestants, over-the-counter pain relievers, and some prescription drugs
  - Kidney Disease
  - Being Overweight Or Obese
  - Physical Inactivity
  - Old Age
  - Stress

  '''   To monitor health risks such as hypertension, it is necessary to observe things such as blood pressure. 

    Blood pressure is the force of blood circulation on the artery walls. 
It is expressed as a measurement with two numbers, with one number at the top (systolic) and on on the bottom (diastolic). 
Blood pressure is measured in units of millimeters of mercury (mmHg). An example of a blood pressure measurement is 120/80 mmHg.

	  Systolic blood pressure is the force of blood against your artery walls while your ventricles squeeze and push blood out to the rest of your body. 

    Diastolic blood pressure is the pressure in the arteries when the heart rests between beats. This is the time when the heart fills with blood and gets oxygen.
''',
// Article 5
  '''   A way to gauge your health is through the heart rate.

    The Heart Rate, or pulse, is the number of times your heart beats per minute. Pulses are often most prominent in areas such as the insides of the elbow, wrists, side of the neck, and top of the foot. 
    
    Heart rates per individual may vary depending on factors like physical activeness and medication intake. A normal or resting heart rate ranges from 60 to 100 BPM (Beats Per Minute). This may vary with athletes. Numbers consistently above and below that range may indicate underlying problems.
''',
// Article 6
  '''   The best way to maintain adequate heart health is by modifying destructive habits and including practices beneficial to your body\’s well-being. 

    Reducing your body\’s intake of added sugars, sodium, and fats (saturated and trans) by substituting these with whole foods may help prevent the build-up of cholesterol in the arteries and provide your body with the nutrition it needs. 

    Exercising can also help in boosting muscle strength, endurance, and efficiency of the cardiovascular system. 
This can enhance the body\’s ability to distribute oxygen and nutrients to the tissues. 
Additionally, a person attains a healthy weight through physical activity. 

    It is also necessary to cut out habits such as smoking, excessive intake of caffeine or alcohol, and intake of illegal drugs that may aggravate your body\’s overall health and lead to a weaker functioning body.

// Article 7
  '''   Checking for your blood pressure is not only evident when you go to your doctor's office or a clinic; you can monitor your own blood pressure at your home on a regular basis. 

    With blood pressure monitors, you can determine your blood pressure health, and identify if you are at risk for hypertension!

    However, factors may cause blood pressure measurement inaccuracies so you should: 

Do's: 
  - Sit quietly and rest for five minutes before taking blood pressure
  - Wait for 30 minutes after eating food, drinking coffee, consuming alcohol, or smoking before measuring blood pressure
  - Sit in a chair with your feet on the floor with your arm supported so your elbow is around heart level
  - Take your blood pressure twice a day: morning and evening
  - The blood pressure cuff should be placed on bare skin.
  - Confirm your blood pressure readings by taking 2 or 3 readings in one occassion if there are reading differences.

Don'ts: 
  - Exercising before taking blood pressure measurements
  - Not relaxing before taking blood pressure measurements.
  - Eating food, drinking coffee, consuming alcohol, or smoking before taking blood pressure measurements.
  - Having bad posture and crossing your legs while taking your blood pressure
  - Not taking blood pressure measurements in a room temperature environment (too cold or hot) 
  - Talking during the measurement
